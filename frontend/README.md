## Leaderboard Demo

The Green Leaderboard is a leaderboard showcasing the stats of every Storage Provider in the Filecoin network. It is by default sorted by the overall green reputation score of each SP but can also be sorted by the individual metrics that make up the overall green score. The leaderboard can also be filtered by region to see the SP rankings per region. This will be useful for client users to view before deciding which SP to store their data with (in the hopes that they will choose SP's with higher green reputation scores to further incentivize SP's to operate in a green manner).

To learn more about the calculation behind the green reputation score, go to [/score](/score/).

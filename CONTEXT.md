# Motivation and Objective

The Filecoin Network, one of the most actively utilized blockchains with over 15 EiB of data storage capabilities, aims to become one of the greenest networks in the world. However, it's no secret that it takes a tremendous amount of energy consumption in order to facilitate a decentralized network of storage providers. So in order to make the Filecoin Network more eco-friendly, we have to start with its Storage Providers.

So the problem statement I hoped to tackle for my project was "How do we incentivize Filecoin Storage Providers to be more green?"

Outside of financial incentives, one of the best ways to construct an incentive structure is to leverage the human desire for honor and status - essentially, construct a value hierarchy by which we measure individuals by a particular metric, in the hopes that they act in the direction that's best to optimize for that metric to move themselves upwards in the system.

So what if we constructed a community honor system for Filecoin Storage Providers to incentivize the them to operate in a more eco-friendly manner? That was the motivation behind the creation of "EcoSoul": A community hub for Filecoin Storage Providers to track their "green reputation score" both on- and off-chain.

The project involved the following three components:

1. Green Reputation Score
2. Community NFT
3. Leaderboard

This project built during the 2022 Sustainability Blockchain Hackathon hosted by Protocol Labs.
